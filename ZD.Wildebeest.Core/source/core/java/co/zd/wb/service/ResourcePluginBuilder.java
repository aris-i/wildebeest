/**
 * A ResourcePluginBuilder is a factory component for building {@link ResourcePlugin}s.
 * 
 * It's expected that ResourcePluginBuilders's will typically be stateful, with properties or configuration information
 * being supplied to them as properties.  The reset() method should be implemented to clear such additional state and
 * restore the ResourcePluginBuilder to a clean state ready to be re-used to build a different ResourcePlugin.  The
 * framework will always call reset() before using an ResourcePluginBuilder.

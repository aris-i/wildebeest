/**
 * An InstanceBuilder is a factory component for building {@link Instance}s.
 * 
 * It's expected that InstanceBuilders's will typically be stateful, with properties or configuration information being
 * supplied to them as properties.  The reset() method should be implemented to clear such additional state and restore
 * the InstanceBuilder to a clean state ready to be re-used to build a different Instance.  The framework will always
 * call reset() before using an InstanceBuilder.

/**
 * An AssertionBuilder is a factory component for building instances of {@link Assertion}s.  The build method takes the
 * common properties of an Assertion as parameters.
 * 
 * It's expected that AssertionBuilder's will typically be stateful, with additional properties or configuration
 * information being supplied to them as properties.  The reset() method should be implemented to clear such additional
 * state and restore the AssertionBuilder to a clean state ready to be re-used to build another Assertion instance.  The
 * framework will always call reset() before using an AssertionBuilder.
